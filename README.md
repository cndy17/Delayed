# Delayed
I will be predicting whether the arrival delay time is greater than a threshold of 5 minutes using a logistic regression and random forest. 

Data Set: Airline Service Quality Performance 234 (On-Time Performance Data)
This data has been reported by U.S. certificated air carriers so that information on the air carriers' quality of service can be made available to consumers of air transportation. The data is from October 1987 to April 2008. It includes historical on-time performance data from air carriers between October 1987 and April 2008, which can be used to predict whether a flight has an arrival delay greater than 5 minutes (derived from ArrDelay) from other related metrics.

Size: The dataset is relatively large (over 10 GB).
